# point_cloud_3D_modelling
#3D modelling of industrial environments point clouds for acoustic simulation
#The requirements for acoustic simulations are as follows:
#-3D wireframe models based on lines and polylines
#-Flat surfaces and sufficiently large in relation to wavelength
#-Layered Stored Surfaces
